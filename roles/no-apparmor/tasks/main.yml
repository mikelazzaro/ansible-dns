# I'm sure apparmor is a great tool, but I didn't have time to
#   learn it during this project, so I disabled it for the moment,
#   and threw a task in the backlog to come back to it.

  service:

# Note 2: apparmor uses the 'service' syntax, but 'teardown' isn't supported by
#         Ansible's service module, so we can ignore the warning
